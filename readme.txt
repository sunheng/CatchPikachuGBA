Pikachus, I choose you!

You play as a pokeball. Your goal is to catch 5 pikachus to win. What stand in your way are these ugly meowths that nobody wants. They will try to get into your pokeball, savages. Avoid these meowths and capture your pikachus.

You lose if one of the meowths catches you. You win after catching 5 pikachus.

Start the game by pressing enter.

During the game, you can press backspace to restart the game.

Use the arrow keys to move your pokeball.

Gotta catch em' all...but the meowths.
